		<div>The Dragon Show</div>
		<div>It could not be denied, dragons, although dangerous ,were extremely entertaining creatures.,Â  so entertaining in fact that soon dragon shows were all the rage in the kingdom of UZ. Everyone in the kingdom went to some kind of dragon show at least once a week and many would go every night. If dragon shows weren't addictive they certainly were habit forming. Everyone in the Kingdom was happy, the people were entertained, the dragon show owners got rich and the King was left in peace.</div>
		<div>Back</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Yes, everyone was happy, except for a few doctors, who began to notice a strange phenomenon. It seemed that along with the increase in dragon show attendance there was also an increase in the number of patients with severe burns, and large fang wounds. Could it be that the dragons were attacking the spectators?</div>
		<div>"Oh no," said the dragon show owners who attributed the burns and wounds to over zealous cooks and ferocious pets. "It can't be the fault of dragons. Our shows are perfectly safe."</div>
		<div>The dragon show owners, however, took the complaints seriously and countered with a massive advertising campaign touting the pleasures one could derive from the dragon shows and denying the danger to the audiences of dragon attack. Soon the dragon's attacks on their audiences had become so overt and frequent that the members of the audience began to complain to the dragon show owners.</div>
		<div>"I saw your dragon eat the man sitting next to me. Your dragon ate my wife etc. etc..""Oh no you must be mistaken. You can't actually prove our dragons have eaten anyone" was the standard reply.
Getting no satisfaction from the dragon show owners some people took their complaints to the king. The king , however, in a fit of liberalism had converted the kingdom to a direct democracy and needed the financial contributions of the dragon show owners in order to win the annual elections and keep his crown. He was not about to kill the goose that laid his golden egg.
He finally agreed to put small signs outside dragon shows warning prospective audiences that viewing dragon show might be dangerous to your health. There effectiveness however was completely undone by a bigger ad campaign launched by the Dragon Owners Assn. preaching the pleasures gained by going to the dragon shows.
</div>
		<div>Finally, as the hospital beds and graveyards continued to fill with the victims of the dragon attacks, the audiences began to dwindle. The dragon owners dismayed at the loss of their revenues increased their advertising efforts but to no avail. Word had spread throughout the Kingdom that those who went to dragon shows stood a good chance of being eaten.</div>
		<div>Things looked bleak for the dragon show industry until in a flash of marketing brilliance the dragon owners association hit upon what became known in their inner circles as the Kid theory. They had been targeting the wrong audiences. Adults, aware of their own mortality, had become frightened at the prospect of being eaten by a dragon. Children, however, still thinking of themselves as immortal had no such fear and could easily be lured into the dangers of the dragon show.The Kid strategy was initiated. Dragon shows were set up outside schools so children could attend them during their lunch hours; advertising space was taken out in comic books showing how cool it was to go to dragon shows, even prizes were given to those children attending the most dragon shows. The kid strategy was wildly successful and the number of children regularly attending dragon shows sky rocked, unfortunately so did the death rate of the adolescent population.</div>
		<div>As its younger population slowly disappeared the Kingdom of UZ gradually lost the ability to replenish itself and it withered away, consumed in the dragon's fire.</div>
